This example demonstrates the issue of unordered iteration in Perl hashes. The foreach loop iterates through the keys of the hash, but the order is not guaranteed to be consistent. This can lead to unexpected results if the order of elements is important for the program's logic. The bugSolution.pl file provides a solution using a sorted key list to ensure consistent iteration order.
